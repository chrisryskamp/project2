# Flashcard Maker - Project Two

* Our group created a web app that stores and shows flashcards. 

* The app has pre-populated flashcards based on commonly needed coding subjects, stored in a MySQL database.

* The user can create their own flashcards using a form, the entries are stored in MySQL. 

* The app utilizes standard CRUD methods for altering the database. 

* We used Pug, a templating engine similar to handlebars. 

* This app follows the MVC paradigm.
