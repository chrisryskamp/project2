# Flashcard Maker - Project Two

* Our group will create a web app that stores and shows flashcards. 

* The app will have pre-populated flashcards based on commonly needed coding subjects, stored in a MySQL database.

* The user will be able to create their own flashcards using a form, those entries will be stored in MySQL. 

* The app will utilize standard CRUD methods for altering the database. 

* We will use Pug, a templating engine similar to handlebars. 

* The app will be deployed on Heroku using a Node and Express Web Server

* This app will follow the MVC paradigm.
